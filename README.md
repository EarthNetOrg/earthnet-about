2. [a digital directory](#the-earthnet-directory)
3. [a non-profit organization](#the-earthnet-organization).

## The EarthNet Ecosystem

### High-level Features of the EarthNet Ecosystem

The larger EarthNet platform should incorporate the following: 

#### 1. Repository System: 
- Each challenge area (or topic), organization, group, and project within the EarthNet ecosystem should have its own "repository", a GitHub repository makes the most sense given the need to fork and merge (see below), but could also be a google doc/drive, or IPFS.
- Repositories store research papers, case studies, tools, best practices, and even datasets.
- Each repository has a "README" that provides an overview and guides newcomers.

#### 2. Fork and Merge Model:
- If a member or subgroup within the community wants to try a different strategy or approach, they should be able to "fork" (copy) the main project to experiment without affecting the original.
- Successful strategies or innovative solutions can be "merged" back into the main repository after review.

#### 3. Collaborative Review / Evaluation:
- Proposed solutions, strategies, or tools undergo a "pull request"-like review, where members of the community vet, provide feedback, and collaboratively refine the proposal.
- Evaluation is based on a standardized impact model or models.
- AI is used to synthesize reviews into actionable feedback.

#### 4. Issues and Milestones:
- "Issues" can be opened to highlight specific challenges and knowledge gaps or seek help on a topic.
- "Milestones" mark significant achievements or phases in a project, tracking progress towards objectives.

#### 5. Open Licensing:
- All resources, tools, and strategies are shared under open licenses, promoting transparency and allowing any community worldwide to utilize and adapt them.

#### 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
- Regularly update and test solutions in real-world settings.
- Successful tests can be rapidly deployed or shared for broader implementation.

#### 7. Wiki and Documentation:
- Maintain extensive documentation in an accessible "wiki" format.
- Include guidelines, methodologies, and tutorials.

#### 8. Community Channels:
- Discussion channels or forums for specific topics, enabling continuous dialogue, knowledge exchange, and collaboration.
- Organize regular virtual "sprints" or hackathons to address urgent challenges or innovate on specific topics.
- Community Channels can be hosted on Slack, Discord, Social Roots, or some combination.

#### 9. Recognition System:
- Implement a system (like GitHub's stars or badges) to recognize significant contributors or particularly impactful solutions.
- This incentivizes participation and acknowledges leading innovators.

#### 10. Integration with External Tools:
- Integrate with data visualization tools, simulation software, or other tech solutions that can aid in understanding and addressing systemic challenges.
- Encourage tech-savvy members to develop tools or apps that aid the community.

#### 11. Partnering and Outreach:
- Collaborate with other networks, academic institutions, NGOs, and industries to enhance the community's resources and impact.
- Regularly host webinars, workshops, and conferences to spread awareness and attract more contributors.

#### 12. Feedback Loop:
- Implement regular surveys or feedback mechanisms to understand the community's needs and adapt the platform accordingly.

By adopting a model inspired by GitHub and open-source principles, EarthNet2 can help communities of practice work collectively, transparently, and efficiently to drive innovation and tackle the complex challenges of climate change and social change.


## The EarthNet Directory

The EarthNet Directory is a public directory of topics, communities of practice, organizations, groups, projects, and people focussing on human and environmental health. As a directory, the EarthNet Directory is meant to be an initial gateway into the larger community. We don't intend to replace other digital tools; we aim to fill gaps and provide maps. The EarthNet Directory is meant to be primarily a tool for making connections, defining projects, and getting those projects evaluated. The larger EarthNet community will transcend any single platform and be a larger community of practice focused on planetary health and well-being.

## The EarthNet Organization

The EarthNet Foundation manages the EarthNet directory. It is a non-profit organization based in Canada.

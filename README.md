## The EarthNet Directory

The EarthNet Directory is a public directory of topics, communities of practice, organizations, groups, projects, and people focussing on human and environmental health. As a directory, the EarthNet Directory is meant to be an initial gateway into the larger community. We don't intend to replace other digital tools; we aim to fill gaps and provide maps. The EarthNet Directory is meant to be primarily a tool for making connections, defining projects, and getting those projects evaluated. The larger EarthNet community will transcend any single platform and be a larger community of practice focused on planetary health and well-being.

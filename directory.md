# The EarthNet Directory

The EarthNet Directory (or "Platform") is a directory of the EarthNet community and a map of the EarthNet Ecosystem. It also provides a powerful tool for creating and evaluating projects.
  
## Key Features

#### 1. The Directory:

The EarthNet Directory is a directory of topics, communities of practice, organizations, projects, and people.

- **Public Landing Page** - Every **node** (topic, community of practice, organization, group, project, and person) has a publicly available landing page.
- **Search and filtering** - The Directory has a powerful search and filtering system.
- **Sub directories** - Any given node has its own directory of members.
- **Follow/ Connect** - Any given node can be followed, allowing users to build up their own easy-to-manage directory of topics, community-of-practice, organization, group, project and people.

#### 2. Project Creation and Launch:

The EarthNet Platform helps users create projects. Drawing from a database of best practices, an AI assistant will help users create new projects. Each project will include landing pages, robust project plans, and a subdirectory of members. 

#### 3. Evaluation:

Any node, but primarily projects, can be evaluated based on a flexible framework-based evaluation system.

#### 4. Frameworks:

EarthNet supports an unlimited number of frameworks for creating and evaluating projects.

#### 5. Posts:

EarthNet allows any node to post and cross-post updates, events, job listings, requests, etc.
